# Ethics & Responsible Use Statement

## 1. Intent
The scripts and command snippets provided in this folder are **educational tools** designed to help individuals and organizations understand what information is exposed on a local network and how to mitigate those exposures. They are **not** intended for malicious activity.

## 2. Reasonable Safeguards Implemented by the Author
1. **Clear Disclaimer** – Every file (README, commands, and this ethics document) prominently states that the tools must be used only on networks where the user has explicit authorization.  
2. **Permission Emphasis** – Each command example includes a warning that elevated privileges (`sudo`) are required and that users must obtain proper consent before scanning.  
3. **Scope Limitation** – The examples focus on typical home/office LAN ranges (`192.168.x.x`, `10.x.x.x`, `172.16‑31.x.x`) and do not contain any payloads, exploits, or destructive actions.  
4. **No Automated Exploitation** – The repository contains only discovery commands (port scanning, ARP enumeration, socket listing). No code is provided that attempts to compromise or gain unauthorized access to identified services.  
5. **Contribution Guidelines** – The `README` invites contributors to submit improvements only if they adhere to the same responsible‑use policy, and pull requests are expected to be reviewed for compliance.

## 3. User Responsibilities
- **Obtain Authorization** – Before executing any command, verify that you have written permission from the network owner.  
- **Respect Privacy** – Do not collect, store, or share personally identifiable information (PII) obtained during scans unless explicitly permitted.  
- **Comply with Law** – Follow applicable local, national, and international regulations governing network probing and data collection.  
- **Report Findings** – If you discover vulnerable devices on a network you do not control, consider notifying the responsible party through responsible disclosure channels.
